A simple example intended to test error handling in Incr\_dom, in
particular to make sure that uncaught errors are captured by Async's
monitors.

This example also tests the use of the ~stop~ argument to
~Start_app.simple~.

You can specify which kind of action should fail with the dropdown, or
by putting ~?Exn_location~ at the end of the URL.
