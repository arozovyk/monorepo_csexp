This directory contains a few examples of how the Incr_dom library
can be used.

** The examples, explained
   
(Examples with asterisks in front of their name link to in-depth
guides. The rest are stubs.)

- *[[./text_input/README.md][Text_input]]: Start here. This example unpacks a basic Incr_dom
  application, explaining how all the various parts hang
  together. (The app implements a model-driven text input.) 
- *[[./ts_gui/README.md][Ts_gui]]: A mockup of a very simple trading-system GUI.
- Incr_decr: The simplest example, which you should be able to
  understand after reading through the Text_input guide. Makes use of
  [[https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/incr_dom/Incr_dom/Incr/Map/index.html#val-mapi][Incr.Map.mapi']].
- [[./entry_table/README.md][Entry_table]]: A curses-like application that lets you move with the
  keyboard through rows of fake data that are constantly ticking with
  new information.
- Event_propagation: An app that demonstrates DOM event propagation.
- [[./monitor/README.org][Monitor]]: Showcases error handling in Incr_dom.
- [[./partial_rendering_table/README.org][Partial_rendering_table]]: Uses the ~Partial_render_list~ module
  that's a part of Incr_dom_widgets to partially render a long
  vertical list.
- [[./todo_mvc/README.md][Todo_mvc]]: Implements the TODO MVC app using Incr_dom.
