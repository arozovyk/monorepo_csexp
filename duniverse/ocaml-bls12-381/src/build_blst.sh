# Modifying `libblst/build.sh` is avoided because we want to keep the fork
# clean.

# is not officially supported). See .github/workflows/build-blst-on-macos for the reason

# libblst/build.sh to use ADX instructions. build.sh uses /proc/cpuinfo to
# decide to use ADX or not. Useful if you build binaries for archs not
# supporting ADX on a arch supporting ADX.
